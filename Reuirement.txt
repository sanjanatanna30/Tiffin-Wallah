and name of website is : Tiffin Wallah
 ### Website Pages Required:

 1. Homepage – Describe the food delivery platform, value proposition, call to action to sign up or login.
 2. About Us Page – Include information about the purpose of the platform, mission, and contact details.
 3. Login Page – A single login form for both customers and providers with email and password fields.
 4. Registration Page – Two separate user roles: Customer and Provider.

    * Fields for both:

      * Full Name
      * Email ID
      * Password
      * Confirm Password
      * Phone Number
      * Address
 5. Contact Us Page – Simple form with name, email, message.
 6. Add to Cart Page – For customers to select food items from different providers.

 ### Functional Requirements:

 * User authentication and role-based access (Customer vs Provider)
 * Food Providers can manage menus
 * Customers can browse food items, add to cart, and place orders
 * Orders stored in database with status tracking
 * Dashboard should be dynamic and responsive for both roles

 ### Technologies:

 * Frontend: React.js with React Router for navigation, Context API or Redux for state management
 * Backend: Express.js with Node.js
 * Database: MongoDB Atlas
 * Authentication: JWT-based authentication

 Build this project with best practices for folder structure (separate frontend and backend), use React functional components, and make the UI user-friendly with responsive design using TailwindCSS or Bootstrap.
